# Decision Tree Classifier Project

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline using Decision Tree-based models for classification tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using various tree-based classifiers including `sklearn`, `LightGBM`, and `XGBoost`.

## 📊 Description

The notebook explores different tree-based models such as:
- Decision Trees (from scikit-learn)
- Gradient Boosted Trees using XGBoost and LightGBM

It also includes:
- Hyperparameter tuning using `skopt`
- Visualization of feature importance
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🧰 Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- scikit-optimize
